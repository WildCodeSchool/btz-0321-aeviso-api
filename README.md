API REST made for AEVISO client project: https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/btz-0321-aeviso-client.  
With jwt authentication.

## Prerequisites

- Docker: [Link](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Node: [Link](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Setup

Run those commands
```sh
git clone https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/btz-0321-aeviso-api.git
cd btz-0321-aeviso-api
npm install
```

We use a POSTGRESQL database. If you already have it, paste the url in DATABASE_URL environment variable (in your .env file at the root of the project).  
If not, a `docker-compose.yml` file can be used:

- Be sure your docker app is running
- In your terminal, run `docker-compose up -d`

Check if the container is running now with an `adminer` image at `8080` port, and a `postgres` image at `5342` port.  
Check if the `aeviso` database was created running `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.  
If all is ok, you should be on the adminer login page. Complete the form like that:

![Adminer](images/adminer_form.png)

password: `aeviso`.

`aeviso` database should appear in the list, but it's empty.

- If done, paste `DATABASE_URL=postgres://aeviso:aeviso@localhost:5432/aeviso` in your .env
- Now you can run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create tables and schemas in you db. Confirm message should appear in your console.
- If you want to push some datas in the db, run `node prisma/seed.js`
- If you read the seed file, you can see that all users's created passwords will be "password".
- Run `npx prisma studio` to launch an interface that displays all datas in your web browser (you can use any credential to log you in).
